# Library Management System (Java)

## Overview
The **Library Management System** is a console-based application developed using **Core Java** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.  
It provides basic library operations such as managing books, managing members, issuing books, and returning books through a menu-driven interface.

This project demonstrates strong fundamentals in Java, OOP design, and the Java Collections Framework.

## Features
- Add new books to the library
- View available books
- Add library members
- View registered members
- Issue books to members
- Return issued books
- Menu-driven console interaction

---

## Technologies Used
- **Java (Core Java)**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Java Collections Framework**
- **Eclipse IDE**
- **Git & GitHub**

---

## OOP Concepts Applied
- **Encapsulation** – Data hiding using private fields and public methods  
- **Abstraction** – Clear separation of responsibilities across classes  
- **Classes & Objects** – Real-world entities like Book, Member, and Library  
- **Modularity** – Each class handles a specific functionality

## How the Application Works
1. The program starts from `Main.java`
2. A menu is displayed to the user
3. User selects operations using numeric input
4. The system performs actions using Java Collections
5. Results are displayed in the console

---

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository or download the project
2. Open the project in **Eclipse IDE**
3. Navigate to `Main.java`
4. Right-click → **Run As → Java Application**
5. Follow the instructions shown in the console
